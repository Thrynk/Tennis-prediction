Calculate features : 
	Historical averaging:
		First serve success percentage : FS
			p_1st_in / p_sv_pt

		Winning on first serve percentage : W1SP
			p_1st_won / p_1st_in

		Winning on second serve percentage : W2SP
			p_2nd_won / (p_sv_pt - p_1st_in)

		Winning on return percentage : WRP
            (o_sv_pt - o_1st_won - o_2nd_won)/o_sv_pt

		Percentage of all points won : TPW
    		( p_1st_won + p_2nd_won + (o_sv_pt - o_1st_won - o_2nd_won) ) / (p_sv_pt + o_sv_pt)

		Percentage of all matches won : TMW
			number of matches won / number of matches played
			(p_matches)/(p_matches + o_matches)

		Average number of aces per game : ACES
			p_ace/p_sv_gms

		Average number of double faults per game : DF
			p_df/p_sv_gms

		Percentage of break points won : BP
			(p_bp_sv + o_pb_sv) / (p_bp_fc + o_bp_fc) 

New features :
	Overall winning on serve percentage : WSP 		par joueur : WSP = W1SP · FS + W2SP(1 - FS)	WSP = WSP1 - WSP2
	Advantage when serving : SERVEADV			par joueur : SERVEADV1 = WSP1 - WRP2		SERVEADV = SERVEADV1 - SERVEADV2
	Player completeness : COMPLETE				par joueur : COMPLETEi = WSPi · WRPi
