# Data collection

We collected our data with the same database as for rank prediction.

# Primary data exploration

We want to describe all the features of our dataset, to see what we collected.

# Data cleaning

In this step, we want to clean or data. Handle missing values and outliers.

- Correcting
- Completing

# Feature engineering

We want to create some features that may be useful to our algorithm.

- Creating

# Exploratory Data Analysis

We want to understand which feature seems important for our model.

- Correlating
- Visualization

# Modeling, prediction

We want to convert some features for the algorithm.

- Converting

We also want to interpret the results
