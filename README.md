# Tennis-prediction

This is my first project in Data Science. I'm a fan of tennis, after practicing during 7 years. I missed the court.
What could be more interesting than studying Data Science with a little bit of nostalgia.
We tried to answer : Can tennis outcomes be predicted thanks to data available on the internet ?

I did this project with a friend of mine : [Florian DECONINCK](https://github.com/foukette)

We reached an accuracy of 65% by using elo rating of player in a Logistic Regression
